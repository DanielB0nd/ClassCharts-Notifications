# ClassChartsNotif

Requirements:
  BS4
  lxlm
  asyncio
  sqlite3
  urllib
  http.client
  
  
This connects to class charts using your code and DOB to allow you to recieve notifications about new tasks set and behaviour points. I might add some more functionality in the future like notifications if a task is due in the next day and attendence notifications.

Any issues please open an issue.
