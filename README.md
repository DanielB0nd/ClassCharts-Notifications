# ClassCharts-Notifications

Requirements:
  BS4
  lxlm
  asyncio
  sqlite3
  urllib
  http.client
  
  
This connects to class charts using your code and DOB to allow you to recieve notifications about new homework tasks set, behaviour points (positive or negative), new detentions and announcements. You will also be a notification 24hrs before a homework is due but only if you haven't ticked off!

Any issues please open an issue. I have just updated the code for connecting to class charts but so far so good!
